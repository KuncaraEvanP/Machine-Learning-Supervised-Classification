# Machine-Learning-Supervised-Classification
Here I do modelling of Telco Customer Churn Data by using several Supervised Machine Learning Classification models to see the accuracy that can be obtained in the process that I have done. 
The reason for using several algorithm models is to compare and find which algorithm model is the best for the data I use for. This method can be applied when working on a project to get the best results for the project being worked on. 
There is also a Base Line on each algorithm to be a reference for the accurate results we want.

## Objective
- The main target of this project is to predict churn in Telco companies.
- Make the target data into a balanced data. 
- Finding the best accuracy algorithm model.

In this project, several fundamental preprocessing processes are also carried out to improve the accuracy results obtained on each model used. 
Like missing values, duplicated data, and also splitting the data before doing the modelling process, data encoding and others.
